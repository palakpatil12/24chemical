<h1>Flotation Reagent For Mineral Processing Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Flotation reagents are chemicals used to selectively separate minerals during the froth flotation process. These chemicals work by making some minerals hydrophobic, or water-repelling, while others remain hydrophilic, or water-attracting. This selective separation is achieved by adding reagents to the mineral slurry, which then adheres to air bubbles in the mixture and floats to the surface.</p><p>
