<h1>Radiative Cooling Technology Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Radiative cooling technology is a passive cooling method that allows surfaces to release heat by emitting infrared radiation, which passes through the atmosphere and escapes into outer space. Unlike conventional cooling methods that rely on active cooling systems such as air conditioners, radiative cooling works without the need for electricity. This process is based on the principle that certain materials or coatings can efficiently reflect sunlight and radiate heat in the infrared spectrum, thereby cooling surfaces below ambient air temperatures.</p><p>
</p><p>Radiative cooling is particularly effective in regions with hot, sunny climates where traditional cooling systems can be both energy-intensive and costly. The technology typically involves materials that have specific properties, including high reflectivity in the solar spectrum and high emissivity in the infrared spectrum. This enables the material to absorb minimal sunlight while emitting maximum infrared radiation, which can then escape into space.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
