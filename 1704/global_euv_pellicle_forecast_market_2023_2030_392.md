<h1>EUV Pellicle Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The Global EUV Pellicle Market is an essential segment within the semiconductor manufacturing industry, specifically catering to Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography processes. EUV pellicles are ultra-thin membrane materials used to protect photomasks from contamination during semiconductor wafer fabrication. These pellicles enhance yield rates and maintain the integrity of high-precision lithographic processes by preventing particle deposition on the mask surface. The increasing demand for EUV lithography in advanced semiconductor nodes (e.g., 5nm and below) has significantly driven the adoption of EUV pellicles in the industry.</p><p>
