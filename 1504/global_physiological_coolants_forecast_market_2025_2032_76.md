<h1>Physiological Coolants Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Physiological coolants are specialized compounds used to produce cooling sensations without the burning or irritation often associated with traditional cooling agents like menthol. These coolants are odorless and flavorless, allowing them to be applied in a variety of products to enhance user experience. They are commonly used in combination with menthol to extend the cooling effect or paired with fruit flavors to intensify juiciness perception. Their unique characteristics, such as low volatility, enable them to be safe for skin contact, without causing discomfort or burning sensations in sensitive areas like the eyes.</p><p>
</p><p>These cooling agents are used in various applications, including food flavors, daily chemical essences, and tobacco essence products. Physiological coolants can be found in a wide range of consumer goods, such as beverages, cosmetics, oral care products, and personal care items. The versatility of these compounds in delivering intense yet soothing cooling effects has increased their demand in several industries.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
