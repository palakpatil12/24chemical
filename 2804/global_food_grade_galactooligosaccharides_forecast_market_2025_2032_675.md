</p><p><strong>Regionally, North America accounted for approximately USD 161.89 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 5.14% between 2025 and 2032. This growth is largely due to heightened demand for organic and natural ingredients, coupled with the increasing prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders and lifestyle-related health concerns.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are short chains of galactose molecules derived from lactose, commonly found in dairy products. Produced via enzymatic hydrolysis, GOS function as prebiotics—non-digestible fibers that foster the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Unlike other sugars, GOS are resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and are fermented by bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the colon. This fermentation process provides multiple health benefits, such as improved digestive health, enhanced mineral absorption, and boosted immunity. In the food industry, GOS are widely incorporated in infant formulas, dairy products, baked goods, and beverages, catering especially to the health-conscious consumer segment.</strong></p><p>
