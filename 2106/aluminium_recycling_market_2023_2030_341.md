<h1>Aluminium Recycling Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The global aluminium recycling market is projected to maintain steady growth, reaching <strong>US$ 100.22 billion by 2030</strong> from <strong>US$ 99.95 billion in 2023</strong>, reflecting evolving sustainability demands across industries, according to a comprehensive market analysis. While the CAGR remains flat, strategic shifts in circular economy adoption and decarbonization initiatives are reshaping the industry landscape.</strong></p><p>Aluminium recyclingâwhich consumes <strong>95% less energy</strong> than primary productionâhas become pivotal for industries aiming to reduce carbon footprints. This process preserves the metalâs infinite recyclability, making it a cornerstone for <strong>low-carbon manufacturing, electric vehicle (EV) production, and sustainable packaging solutions</strong> globally.</p><p><strong>1. ESG Compliance &amp; Circular Economy Mandates:</strong><br>
Corporates face mounting pressure to meet <strong>Scope 3 emissions targets</strong>, with aluminium recyclers benefiting from legislation like the EUâs Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Over <strong>68%</strong> of automakers now mandate closed-loop recycling in supply chains, while beverage giants like Coca-Cola target <strong>100% recycled aluminium cans</strong> by 2025.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The transportation sector, accounting for <strong>35% of recycled aluminium demand</strong>, is accelerating adoption. EV battery casings and lightweight body panels increasingly use secondary aluminium, with Teslaâs Gigafactories alone consuming <strong>45,000 tonnes annually</strong>. This aligns with global EV production projected to grow at <strong>23% CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p><p><strong>3. Emerging Economies Scaling Infrastructure:</strong><br>
Asia-Pacific dominates with <strong>45% market share</strong>, driven by Chinaâs <strong>âZero Waste Citiesâ</strong> initiative and Indiaâs construction boom. Secondary aluminium usage in regional automotive and building sectors grew <strong>12% YoY in 2023</strong>, outpacing Western markets constrained by stagnant scrap collection rates.</p><p>Despite strong fundamentals, the sector faces headwinds:</p><p><strong>1. Advanced Sorting Technologies:</strong><br>
LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) and AI-driven systems now achieve <strong>99.9% purity</strong> in scrap separation, unlocking high-value aerospace and automotive applications previously reserved for primary aluminium.</p><p><strong>2. Green Aluminium Premiums:</strong><br>
Low-carbon aluminium commands <strong>10-15% price premiums</strong>, with Novelisâ EcoAluxuryâ¢ becoming the first recycled alloy certified for luxury packaging. Blockchain-enabled carbon tracking is becoming industry standard.</p><p><strong>3. Urban Mining Ecosystems:</strong><br>
Japanâs <strong>âTowns as Minesâ</strong> program recovers <strong>96%</strong> of discarded aluminium, while Rio Tintoâs START Initiative deploys IoT sensors to map urban scrap reserves in real-time.</p><p>The market features strong vertical integration, with <strong>Novelis (18% share)</strong> and <strong>Norsk Hydro (12%)</strong> leading through:</p><p>This press release synthesizes findings from the 2024 Global Aluminium Recycling Market Report, featuring proprietary data from 300+ smelters, 40+ scrap trade flows, and regulatory analysis across 60 countries.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
