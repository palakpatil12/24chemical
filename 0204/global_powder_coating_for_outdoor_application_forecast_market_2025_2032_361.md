<strong>Market Size Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Powder coating for outdoor applications is a durable and environmentally friendly finishing process used to protect metal and non-metal surfaces from harsh environmental conditions. It involves applying a dry powder composed of pigments, resins, and additives to a substrate, which is then cured under heat to form a robust, protective layer. Unlike liquid coatings, powder coatings do not require solvents, making them an eco-friendly alternative with superior resistance to UV rays, corrosion, and extreme weather conditions.</p><p>
<strong style="font-size:13px">Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)</strong></p><p>
