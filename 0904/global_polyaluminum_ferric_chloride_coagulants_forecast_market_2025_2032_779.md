<h1>Polyaluminum Ferric Chloride Coagulants Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polyaluminum Ferric Chloride (PAFC) coagulants are specialized chemical compounds used primarily in water treatment processes. These coagulants are a combination of aluminum, ferric chloride, and other additives that enhance their coagulation and flocculation properties. They play a vital role in the removal of suspended particles, organic matter, and contaminants from water, making it safe for consumption and industrial use.</p><p>
</p><p>PAFC coagulants exhibit superior performance compared to conventional coagulants such as aluminum sulfate (alum) and ferric chloride alone. Their higher efficiency in turbidity removal, faster settling rates, and lower sludge production make them a preferred choice in municipal water treatment, industrial wastewater treatment, and other applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
