<h1>Prescale Film Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Prescale Film is a unique pressure-sensitive film that enables users to measure pressure distribution and magnitude. This technology allows industries to visualize and quantify pressure in ways that were previously impossible. The film contains microcapsules that break when pressure is applied, producing a red coloration that indicates the intensity and distribution of force. This capability is critical in applications such as automotive, electronics, and industrial testing, where precision pressure measurement is necessary.</p><p>
