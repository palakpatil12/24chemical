</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Powder Metallurgy Manufacturing are parts made from powdered metal via powder metallurgy (PM). Powder metallurgy refers to processes by which materials or components are made from metal powders. PM processes can avoid, or greatly reduce, the need to use metal removal processes, thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs. Powder metallurgy is also used to make unique materials impossible to melt or form in other ways.</p><p>
