<strong>Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Sec-butyl chloride</strong>, also known as <strong>2-chlorobutane</strong>, is an organic compound with the chemical formula <strong>CâHâCl</strong>. It belongs to the class of <strong>alkyl halides</strong>, where a chlorine atom is attached to the <strong>secondary carbon atom</strong> in the butyl group. Sec-butyl chloride is widely used as an intermediate in organic synthesis, particularly in the production of <strong>pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and specialty chemicals.</strong> Due to its reactive nature, it plays a crucial role in alkylation reactions and is also used in the manufacturing of surfactants and plasticizers.</p><p>
</p><p>The compound appears as a <strong>colorless to pale yellow liquid</strong>, with a pungent odor and a boiling point of approximately <strong>68°C (154°F).</strong> It is soluble in organic solvents but exhibits limited solubility in water. The industrial demand for sec-butyl chloride is driven by its applications in the synthesis of various chemical products across multiple industries, including <strong>petrochemicals and coatings.</strong></p><p>
