<h1>Polymerized Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SSBR) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polymerized Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SSBR) is a high-performance synthetic rubber that is produced by polymerizing butadiene-1,3 and styrene in a hydrocarbon solvent with a lithium-organic catalyst. This process allows for better control over molecular weight distribution and branching, resulting in enhanced elasticity, rolling resistance, and abrasion resistance. SSBR is widely used in tire manufacturing, adhesives, footwear, and bitumen modification, making it a crucial material in various industries.</p><p>
