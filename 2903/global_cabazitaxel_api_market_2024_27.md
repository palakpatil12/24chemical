<h1>Global Cabazitaxel API Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>Report Overview:
Cabazitaxel is a semi-synthetic derivative of the natural taxoid 10-deacetylbaccatin III with potential antineoplastic activity. Cabazitaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, this agent is a poor substrate for the membrane-associated, multidrug resistance (MDR), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors. In addition, cabazitaxel penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
The Global Cabazitaxel API Market Size was estimated at USD 217.86  million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 338.11  million by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.60% during the forecast period.
