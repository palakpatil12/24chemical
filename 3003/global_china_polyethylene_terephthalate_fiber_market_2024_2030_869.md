PET Fiber is a synthetic fiber made from polyethylene terephthalate, widely used in textiles, apparel, home furnishings, and industrial applications due to its strength, durability, and wrinkle resistance.</p><p>
China's PET Fiber market continues to dominate global production, driven by its robust textile industry and growing domestic consumption. In 2023, China produced approximately 38.5 million metric tons of PET fiber, accounting for 65% of global production. The apparel sector remains the largest consumer, representing 58% of demand, followed by home textiles at 25% and technical textiles at 17%. The market saw a significant boost from the recovery of global textile demand, which led to a 12% increase in PET fiber exports in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing high-performance and sustainable PET fibers, with new products offering enhanced moisture-wicking properties and reduced microfiber shedding. The market is seeing strong growth in recycled PET fibers, increasing at 18% annually, driven by fashion brands' sustainability commitments. In 2023, major retailers' pledges to use recycled materials led to a 35% increase in demand for rPET fibers in casual wear. The industry faces challenges from fluctuating raw material prices, with PTA and MEG costs varying by up to 20% in 2023. However, vertical integration strategies are helping major players stabilize costs. Emerging applications in smart textiles are showing promise, with conductive PET fibers for wearable technology growing at 25% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 1.5% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China's push towards higher-value textile products, with specialized PET fibers for automotive and aerospace applications projected to grow at 11% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
