</p><p>This robust growth trajectory is attributed to increasing consumer demand for low-calorie and sugar-reduced products across the globe.</p><p>
</p><p>Emerging economies in <strong>Asia-Pacific</strong> and <strong>Latin America</strong> are also witnessing rapid market expansion due to changing dietary habits, rising disposable incomes, and growing awareness of healthier food options.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Hydrogenated Glucose Syrup</strong>, also referred to as hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (HSH), is a family of sugar alcohol solutions derived from glucose syrups through catalytic hydrogenation. These syrups are typically composed of maltitol, sorbitol, and hydrogenated oligosaccharides. Widely used in food manufacturing, these syrups act as multi-functional ingredients. They not only offer sweetness but also perform roles as humectants, bulk sweeteners, bodying agents, cryoprotectants, and crystallization modifiers. Their ability to retain moisture, extend shelf life, and provide stability under various processing conditions makes them essential in a wide range of applications such as confectionery, baked goods, dairy products, and pharmaceutical formulations.</p><p>
</p><p>Hydrogenated glucose syrups are particularly valued in sugar-free and low-calorie product formulations due to their low glycemic response and tooth-friendly profile. Their smooth texture and thermal stability further contribute to their popularity in industries focused on health-conscious and diabetic-friendly foods.</p><p>
