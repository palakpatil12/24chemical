</p><p>Pre-insulated PEX (Cross-linked Polyethylene) pipe is an advanced piping solution designed for efficient thermal insulation and fluid transportation. This type of pipe consists of three main components: PEX tubing, an insulating layer (typically made of polyurethane foam), and an outer protective jacket (usually composed of high-density polyethylene or another durable material). These pipes are extensively used in applications such as district heating, geothermal heating, industrial fluid transportation, and domestic water supply systems due to their high durability, corrosion resistance, and energy efficiency.</p><p>
