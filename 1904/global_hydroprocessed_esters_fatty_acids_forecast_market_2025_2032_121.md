</p><p>Historical trends also suggest a marked rise in investment and policy support for renewable fuels. From 2018 to 2022, the market experienced a surge in both production capacity and commercial deployment, especially in the U.S. and EU, where stringent carbon reduction mandates are in place.</p><p>
</p><p>Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) refer to a category of renewable fuels derived from lipid feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and used cooking oils. HEFA fuels are primarily used in aviation as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and they also find applications in road transport and other energy-intensive sectors. These biofuels are produced through hydroprocessing, a refining process that involves hydrogenating the feedstocks to remove oxygen and convert them into hydrocarbons. The result is a high-quality, drop-in biofuel that is chemically similar to fossil fuels, enabling seamless integration with existing fuel infrastructure.</p><p>
</p><p>HEFA is widely recognized as a key solution in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially within the aviation industry, which faces limited alternatives for decarbonization. Due to its high energy density and cleaner-burning properties, HEFA has gained traction as a credible and scalable alternative to conventional jet fuels.</p><p>
