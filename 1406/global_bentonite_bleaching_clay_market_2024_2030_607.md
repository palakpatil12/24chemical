<h1>Global Bentonite Bleaching Clay Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>Bentonite Bleaching Clay market</strong> is projected to expand significantly from <strong>2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by escalating demand across edible oil refining, mineral oil processing, and industrial applications. This growth reflects the material's critical role in purification processes, particularly in emerging economies where food safety standards are tightening and industrial activities are expanding.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Edible Oil Consumption &amp; Quality Standards:</strong><br>
Global edible oil consumption has surged by <strong>4.2% annually since 2020</strong>, with bentonite clay becoming indispensable for removing impurities, pigments, and oxidation products. Regulatory bodies now mandate <strong>95%+ contaminant removal</strong> in refined oils, pushing manufacturers to adopt advanced bleaching technologies.</p><p><strong>2. Mineral Oil Industry Modernization:</strong><br>
The mineral oil sector's <strong>US$1.8 trillion valuation</strong> is driving adoption of high-performance bleaching clays to meet API Group II+/III base oil specifications. Recent plant upgrades across the Middle East and Asia incorporate bentonite-based purification systems achieving <strong>99.5% sulphur reduction</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
