These agents serve a critical role in ensuring the quality of the electroplated layer, which is vital for the performance of semiconductor devices. Their primary functions include cleaning, etching, and conditioning the semiconductor surface. By doing so, they optimize the adhesion and uniformity of the electroplated metal, which can significantly impact the electrical performance and reliability of semiconductor components.</p><p>
</p><p>The pretreatment process involves a combination of cleaning agents, etching solutions, and other chemicals that help in removing any unwanted residues, oxides, or contaminants from the surface of the semiconductors. This process ensures that the electroplated metal layer adheres effectively to the semiconductor, thereby enhancing the overall quality and functionality of the device.</p><p>
