The continuous growth in solar installations globally, particularly in Asia-Pacific and emerging economies, is a key factor contributing to market expansion. Despite slower adoption of alternative materials like POE, the market size is expected to gradually rise as the solar industry continues to evolve and demand for bifacial and high-efficiency modules increases.</p><p>
</p><p>Encapsulant materials for photovoltaic (PV) modules are specialized polymer-based substances used to encapsulate solar cells, ensuring mechanical stability and long-term performance. Their primary function is to provide adhesion between the top protective layer (typically glass), the solar cells, and the rear surface. They also play a crucial role in optical coupling by allowing maximum light transmission to the active solar cells. Additionally, encapsulants safeguard the modules from environmental stressors, such as moisture, UV radiation, high temperatures, and mechanical impact. Among the various encapsulants available, Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) has been the most widely adopted, known for its balance between cost, durability, and established supply chain. However, newer alternatives like Polyolefin Elastomer (POE) are gaining traction, especially in the bifacial module segment.</p><p>
