<h1>Dicamba Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Dicamba is a selective herbicide used for controlling broadleaf weeds and woody plants. It is widely applied in agricultural settings, especially in genetically modified (GM) crops such as dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton. Dicamba works by mimicking natural plant hormones, causing uncontrolled growth that leads to plant death. This herbicide is available in multiple formulations, including liquid, granular, and soluble concentrates, making it adaptable for various applications.</p><p>
