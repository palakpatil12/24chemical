</p><p><strong>Pyrocatechol</strong>, also known as catechol or 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, is an organic compound that belongs to the phenol family. It appears as a white, crystalline solid that turns brown when exposed to air and light. Pyrocatechol is primarily used as a chemical intermediate in the production of pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. It is also employed in photographic development, polymer stabilization, and antioxidant formulations. Derived from natural sources such as beechwood tar or synthesized through hydroxylation of phenol, pyrocatechol plays a significant role in industrial chemistry.</p><p>
