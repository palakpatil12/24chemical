<h1>Magnesium Olivine Sand Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>Magnesium Olivine Sand Powder market</strong> is projected to expand significantly from 2024 to 2030, driven by increasing demand across foundry, metallurgy, and refractory applications. This growth is particularly propelled by the material's unique properties, including <strong>high thermal stability, excellent binding characteristics, and environmentally friendly attributes</strong> compared to alternatives like silica sand.</p><p><strong>1. Foundry Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
The foundry sector remains the primary consumer of magnesium olivine sand powder, accounting for over 45% of global consumption. With the global metal casting market expected to maintain steady growth, foundries are increasingly adopting olivine sand due to its <strong>superior dimensional stability</strong> and <strong>reduced health risks</strong> compared to crystalline silica alternatives. Particularly in Europe and North America, stringent workplace safety regulations are accelerating this transition.</p><p><strong>2. Green Steel Production Initiatives:</strong><br>
As steel producers worldwide commit to reducing carbon emissions, magnesium olivine is gaining traction as a fluxing agent in electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking. The mineral's <strong>high magnesium oxide content (45-50%)</strong> makes it valuable for slag formation, helping metallurgical operations improve efficiency while lowering environmental impact. Major steel producers in Europe have begun testing olivine-based solutions to meet their sustainability targets.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
