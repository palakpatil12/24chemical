<h1>Sodium Chlorite for Pulp Application Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>
The global Sodium Chlorite for Pulp Application market revolves around the use of sodium chlorite, a chemical compound, in various applications within the paper and pulp industry. Sodium chlorite is primarily used as a bleaching agent, assisting in the whitening and cleaning of wood pulp, which is a fundamental process in paper production. It serves as a precursor in generating chlorine dioxide, a potent oxidizer used to bleach pulp, remove lignin, and enhance the brightness and whiteness of the paper.</p><p>
</p><p>This compound is also employed for sterilization purposes, particularly in water treatment and disinfection applications, due to its effective bactericidal properties. While its primary use remains in pulp bleaching, sodium chlorite's versatility in other industrial applications such as water treatment, food safety, and medical sterilization has expanded its global market reach.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
