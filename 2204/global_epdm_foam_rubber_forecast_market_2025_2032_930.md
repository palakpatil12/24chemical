</p><p><strong>Historical data also shows a consistent rise in EPDM foam usage, especially with the growing emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency. With governments and industries shifting toward eco-friendly materials, the market is poised for substantial growth through the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>EPDM Foam Rubber is a closed-cell, synthetic foam rubber made from Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM). Known for its excellent resistance to weather, ozone, UV rays, high temperatures, and chemicals, EPDM foam rubber is a durable and versatile material. It is extensively used in automotive, construction, HVAC, and industrial applications for sealing, insulating, cushioning, and gasketing. The closed-cell structure ensures minimal water absorption and high thermal insulation properties, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications. As industries push for long-lasting, weather-resistant solutions, EPDM foam rubber remains a material of choice.</strong></p><p>
