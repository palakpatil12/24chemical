The historical trend shows a steady increase in the adoption of fiber-reinforced composites, particularly in Asia-Pacific, with China leading the charge due to its industrial and infrastructural expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>Over the past decade, the growing emphasis on lightweight, high-performance materials has pushed manufacturers toward E-glass fibers as a cost-effective and sustainable option. Additionally, increasing global investments in wind power generation and electric vehicles (EVs) further augment the demand for E-glass fiber yarns and rovings.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>E-Glass Fiber Yarn &amp; Roving</strong> refers to a category of reinforcement materials primarily composed of extremely fine glass filaments. These materials are spun into yarns and rovings, forming the basis of various composite products. E-glass, where "E" stands for "electrical," was initially designed for electrical insulation applications. Today, it accounts for the majority of fiberglass production globally and serves industries including aerospace, automotive, construction, marine, electronics, and wind energy. Characterized by its alkali-free composition, high tensile strength, and good electrical insulation properties, E-glass fiber is cost-effective and widely used in composite manufacturing. However, due to its susceptibility to chloride ion attack, it is less suitable for marine and corrosive environments.</p><p>
