</p><p>Laboratory glass containers are specialized vessels used for storing, measuring, mixing, and handling chemicals and biological samples in scientific laboratories. These containers are primarily made from borosilicate glass or soda-lime glass due to their excellent thermal resistance, chemical stability, and transparency. Common types include beakers, flasks, test tubes, pipettes, and reagent bottles. Their utility spans across various scientific fields such as chemistry, biology, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. Laboratory glass containers are preferred over plastic alternatives in scenarios demanding high-temperature resistance, contamination prevention, and superior optical clarity.</p><p>
