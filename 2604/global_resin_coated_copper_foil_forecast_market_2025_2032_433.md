<h1>Resin Coated Copper Foil (RCC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Resin coated copper foil (RCC) is an advanced material used in the manufacturing of high-density interconnect (HDI) printed circuit boards (PCBs). RCC primarily utilizes <strong>electrolytic copper foil</strong>, coated with <strong>thermosetting insulating resin</strong>, which includes <strong>epoxy resin</strong> as the main component. Additionally, small amounts of high-performance resins such as <strong>BT (Bismaleimide Triazine), PPE (Polyphenylene Ether), and PI (Polyimide)</strong> are incorporated. Unlike traditional copper-clad laminates (CCLs), RCC eliminates the need for glass cloth reinforcement, reducing weight and thickness while enhancing electrical performance. This makes RCC particularly suitable for <strong>mobile phones, computers, cameras, and other compact electronic devices</strong>.</p><p>
