</p><p>Stainless steel wedge nets, also known as wedge wire screens or profile wire screens, are precision-engineered filtration elements made by welding V-shaped (or wedge-shaped) wire to support rods. These nets offer high mechanical strength, resistance to clogging, and excellent durability in harsh operating environments. They are commonly used in industries like water treatment, pulp and paper, food and beverage, mining, and petrochemicals for filtering, separation, and screening processes. Their customizability and long service life make them an essential component in modern industrial operations.</p><p>
