<h1>Global LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 158.7 billion in 2024 to USD 221.4 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 5.7%</strong> during the forecast period according to latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects the accelerating global energy transition, where cleaner-burning fuels are increasingly replacing coal and oil across industrial, residential, and transportation sectors.</p><p>LNGâmethane cooled to -260Â°F for transportâhas become the <strong>fastest-growing natural gas supply source</strong>, expected to account for <strong>15% of global gas demand by 2030</strong>. Meanwhile, LPG (propane/butane mixtures) maintains strong demand due to its <strong>portability and versatility</strong> in off-grid energy applications. Together, these fuels are critical bridges in the decarbonization journey.</p><p><strong>1. Energy Transition &amp; Environmental Regulations:</strong><br>
With 137 countries now committed to net-zero targets, LNG and LPG are experiencing <strong>20-25% higher demand</strong> in regions implementing coal-to-gas switching. The International Energy Agency notes LNG could displace <strong>500 million tons of CO2 annually</strong> by replacing coal in power generation across Asia.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The UN projects <strong>2.5 billion new urban dwellers</strong> by 2050, primarily in Asia and Africa. This drives exponential demand for clean cooking fuelsâLPG adoption in India's Ujjwala program has reached <strong>95 million households</strong> since 2016, while African LPG demand grows at <strong>8% annually</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. Technological Advancements in Logistics:</strong><br>
Floating LNG (FLNG) technology has reduced project lead times by <strong>30-40%</strong>, while small-scale LNG solutions enable fuel access to remote regions. Virtual pipeline systems using ISO containers now serve <strong>15% of China's industrial gas demand</strong> beyond pipeline networks.</p><p><strong>1. LNG as Marine Fuel:</strong><br>
IMO 2020 sulfur regulations have propelled LNG bunkering to <strong>35% of new vessel orders50 million tons annually by 2030</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Bio-LPG and Renewable Gases:</strong><br>
Waste-to-LPG pathways utilizing agricultural residues could supply <strong>20% of global demand</strong> by 2040. Neste's Singapore plant already produces <strong>400,000 tons/year</strong> of renewable LPG from biofuels.</p><p><strong>3. Digital Trading Platforms:</strong><br>
Blockchain-enabled gas trading grew <strong>300% in 2023</strong>, with platforms like Vakt and Komgo streamlining transactions. Smart contracts now govern <strong>12% of Atlantic Basin LNG trades</strong>, reducing counterparty risks.</p><p>The market features <strong>integrated majors</strong> (Shell, TotalEnergies), <strong>NOCs</strong> (QatarEnergy, ADNOC), and <strong>trading specialists</strong> (Trafigura, Gunvor). Recent strategic moves include:</p><p>This analysis draws from the comprehensive report <em>Global LNG and LPG Market Outlook 2024-2030</em>, featuring:
