Stringent VOC regulations in Europe and North America are accelerating the shift to <strong>water-based and UV-cured gravure inks</strong>, which now constitute <strong>28% of the market</strong>. Major brands like Amcor and Constantia Flexibles have committed to 100% sustainable ink solutions by 2025, pushing manufacturers to reformulate.</p><p><strong>3. Technological Advancements in Ink Formulations:</strong><br>
Next-generation gravure inks with <strong>faster drying times</strong> (reduced by 40% in latest formulations) and <strong>enhanced color gamuts</strong> are gaining traction. Recent breakthroughs in nanoparticle pigment technology have enabled <strong>20% material reduction</strong> while maintaining print qualityâa key cost-saving innovation.</p><p>Despite strong demand, the industry faces several headwinds:</p><p><strong>1. Bio-Based Ink Development:</strong><br>
Plant-derived gravure inksâcurrently just <strong>7% of the market</strong>âare forecast to grow at <strong>9% annually</strong> through 2030. Innovators like Flint Group are commercializing soy- and algae-based formulations with comparable performance to conventional options.</p><p><strong>2. Smart Packaging Integration:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 26 billion smart packaging market</strong> presents new avenues for functional gravure inks. Conductive inks for printed electronics and temperature-sensitive inks for freshness indicators are seeing <strong>triple-digit growth</strong> in pharmaceutical and food applications.</p><p><strong>3. Emerging Market Expansion:</strong><br>
Asia-Pacific's gravure ink demand is surging at <strong>5.8% annually</strong>, fueled by India's packaging boom and China's e-commerce expansion. Local manufacturers are gaining ground with <strong>30-40% cost advantages</strong> over imported products.</p><p>The market features a mix of global chemical conglomerates and specialized ink producers. <strong>Flint Group</strong> and <strong>DIC Corporation</strong> lead with <strong>combined 38% market share</strong>, benefiting from integrated pigment supply chains. Regional players like <strong>Sakata Inx</strong> and <strong>Toyo Ink</strong> are gaining share through localized R&amp;D and rapid customization capabilities.</p><p>Notable developments include <strong>Siegwerk's</strong> acquisition of ACTEGA Colorchem to expand in water-based inks and <strong>Hubergroup's</strong> recent launch of bio-renewable gravure inks with <strong>85% bio-content</strong>.</p><p>This analysis is based on the comprehensive market study "Global Inks for Gravure Printing Market Research Report 2024 (Status and Outlook)", providing in-depth segmentation, competitive analysis, technology trends, and growth forecasts through 2030.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
