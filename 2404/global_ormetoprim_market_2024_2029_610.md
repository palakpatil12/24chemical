</p><p>Ormetoprim is an antibiotic used in veterinary medicine, typically in combination with sulfadimethoxine. It's commonly used in the poultry and aquaculture industries to prevent the spread of disease. Ormetoprim works by inhibiting the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid by bacterial cells, similar to other diaminopyrimidines like trimethoprim. The optimal ratio of sulfadimethoxine to ormetoprim has been found to be 20:1, but it's sold pharmaceutically as a 5:1 mixture.</p><p>
