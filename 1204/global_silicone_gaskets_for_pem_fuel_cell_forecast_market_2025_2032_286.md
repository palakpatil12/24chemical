<h1>Silicone Gaskets for PEM Fuel Cell Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Silicone gaskets for PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cells are integral components that ensure the efficient operation of fuel cells. These gaskets function as sealing agents in the stack assembly, providing the necessary compression and acting as barriers to prevent fuel leaks. By maintaining proper sealing, they maximize the efficiency of the fuel cell and ensure the durability of the stack. Silicone gaskets are particularly favored due to their excellent heat resistance, elasticity, and chemical inertness, which make them ideal for demanding applications in energy and automotive sectors.</p><p>
