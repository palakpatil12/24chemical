<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Powder decorative coating, commonly known as powder coating, is a dry finishing process that involves the electrostatic application of finely ground pigment and resin particles onto a substrate. Once applied, the coated object undergoes curing in a specialized oven, allowing the powder to melt and form a uniform, durable finish. This method is widely preferred in automotive, furniture, architectural, and industrial applications due to its superior durability, environmental benefits, and aesthetic appeal. Unlike liquid coatings, powder coatings contain no solvents, making them an eco-friendly alternative that reduces volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)</strong></p><p>
<strong>Drivers</strong></p><p>
