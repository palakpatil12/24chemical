*Recently, after 16 months of construction, China Xingfa Groupâ€™s 55km long phosphate concentrate pipeline transport project was completed on the 19 March, 2024. This is the first phosphate pipeline project in Hubei Province. After completion, 2 million tons of phosphate will ?flow? out of Xingshan through this pipeline every year. The project takes a total investment of RMB300 million yuan, the transportation cost of 2 million tons of phosphate from the mine down here is RMB 40 million yuan per year, meaning that after the project becomes operational, the transportation cost can be recovered in about 8 years.</p><p>
