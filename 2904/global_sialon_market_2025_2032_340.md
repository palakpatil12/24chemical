<h1>?-Sialon Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Sialon ceramics belong to a specialized class of high-temperature refractory materials known for their superior properties compared to traditional ceramics like alumina. They exhibit exceptional strength, even at high temperatures, alongside remarkable resistance to thermal shock, corrosion, and wetting by molten non-ferrous metals. These unique characteristics make them indispensable in applications such as handling molten aluminum and corrosion-resistant components in the chemical industry. Furthermore, Sialons possess high wear resistance, low thermal expansion, and excellent oxidation resistance at temperatures exceeding 1000°C. Initially developed by Kenneth Henderson Jack in 1984, Sialons have since become critical in various industrial sectors requiring durable, high-performance ceramic materials.</p><p>
