<h1>Hollow-core Fibers Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Hollow core fiber (HCF) is a specialized type of optical fiber that uses a hollow core instead of the traditional solid core found in standard fibers. The hollow core is surrounded by a periodic array of air holes, which guide light through the core using a mechanism that is distinct from the traditional solid-core fibers. The design and structure of hollow core fibers allow them to overcome certain limitations of solid-core fibers, particularly in terms of light propagation and performance under certain conditions.</p><p>
</p><p>Hollow-core fibers can be broadly classified into three primary categories based on the light-guiding mechanism used:</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
