<h1>Size Exclusion Chromatography Resin Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Size exclusion chromatography (SEC), also referred to as gel filtration chromatography, is a technique used in analytical chemistry to separate molecules based on their size. This method utilizes a porous stationary phase, typically packed into a column, through which a mixture of molecules is passed. The pores within the stationary phase allow smaller molecules to enter and move more slowly through the column, while larger molecules, unable to enter the pores, pass through more quickly. This differential movement results in the separation of the components of the sample.</p><p>
</p><p>Unlike other chromatography techniques such as ion exchange chromatography (IEX) or affinity chromatography (AC), molecules in SEC do not bind to the resin. Therefore, the composition of the buffer used during the process does not directly influence the resolution of the separation. This makes SEC a mild and versatile technique, suitable for a wide range of applications, from protein purification to environmental testing. It is particularly effective for the separation of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides, which is why it is widely used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
