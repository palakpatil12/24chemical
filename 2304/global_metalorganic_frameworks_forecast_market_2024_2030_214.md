Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) also called as Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs) or coordination networks are crystalline material that can be readily self-assembled from metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. They display permanent porosity with the enormous internal surface area and large structural diversity and thus lead to a wide spectrum of applications including gas capture and storage, molecule separations, ion-exchange, drug delivery, sensing, catalysis, luminescence. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are (often) crystalline materials that possess nanometer-sized cavities and exhibit large internal surface areas (&gt;7000 m2/g) decorable with functional groups. MOFs are synthesized modularly from molecular building blocks: organic linker molecules and inorganic nodes. owing to the (i) abundance of compatible molecular building blocks, (ii) many topologies in which the building blocks assemble, and (iii) post-synthetic modifiability, the number of possible MOF structures is practically limitless.</p><p>
