<h1>Retroreflective Material Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Retroreflectivity is an optical phenomenon that describes an object's ability to reflect light back to its source. This effect is achieved using retroreflectors, which employ multiple internal reflections to return incident light to its origin with minimal scattering. Retroreflective materials are widely used in traffic signs, road markings, safety apparel, and various industrial applications to enhance visibility in low-light conditions.</p><p>
